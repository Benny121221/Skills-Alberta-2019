Simply sign up for your free account and start earning rewards points every time you fly. Points accumulate quickly and can easily be redeemed for flights and other great rewards.

Ready to start earning High Flyer Rewards points? All you have to do is join the program and start flying! Points add up quickly and you'll be redeeming yours for great rewards before you know it.
Membership Levels
The High Flyer Rewards Program offers two levels of membership.
Level 1 - High Flyer - 0 to 99 flights
Anyone can join as a High Flyer member to begin earning points. Points are earned at a rate of 10% of the base fare per flight and can be redeemed for flights and other great rewards at any time. Points can be earned on domestic and international scheduled service flights and panorama tours operated by Rapid Air, Whistler Air, Saltspring Air and Tantalus Air.
Level 2 - Elite High Flyer - 100+ flights 
To qualify for Level 2 status, passengers will have traveled on 100 or more one-way flights in a year. Our Elite High Flyers enjoy the same benefits as Level 1 members plus some extras to recognize their ongoing loyalty. These frequent flyers are the passengers we see most often, our staff know them by name and probably know what Select Seat they'll choose before they even get to the check-in desk. We'll keep track of how often passengers fly and will personally contact those guests who have qualified for Elite High Flyer status.

Become a Member
Once you have flown with us for the first time, joining the High Flyer Rewards Program is easy (and free), simply fill out the application form below.
Choose from three types of membership plans: individual, family, or corporate. The primary High Flyer Rewards account holder can choose to add members to their family or corporate plan so earned points are pooled together. They may also choose which members are authorized to redeem points.
Once your membership has been activated, you will receive a confirmation email indicating your High Flyer membership number which will be linked to your customer profile (HAS#). Don't worry - we'll take a look back at the last three months and credit you for any flights you've already taken.
